# IoT-Message-Board
Adapted for a project to use with a 4.2" WaveShare e-paper display with a Raspberry Pi using Python3 from a tutorial by James Bruton. Including his original liscense.

Here is the [link to James' Awesome IoT Message Board tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGsRJhoF5yY&feature=emb_title)  with [plenty of information including a link to how to get set-up and started with Google's gspread API](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/07/read-and-update-google-spreadsheets-with-python/).
